# Ship Studio

> How professionals build with AI. No coding required.

## Brand Identity
- Personality: Professional, human-first, and simple to use.
- Colors:
  - Primary: `--accent` (`#FF5E00`)
  - Secondary accent: `--accent-secondary` (`#F7941D`)
  - Neutrals: `--background` (`#FAF3E8`), `--foreground` (`#0D0D0D`), `--muted` (`#999999`)
  - Functional: `--success` (`#10B981`), `--warning` (`#F59E0B`), `--error` (`#EF4444`)
- Fonts: `Alexandria` (display/headings) and `Plus Jakarta Sans` (body/UI text).

## Pages
- Homepage (`/`) - Hero video, logo marquee, who we are, services bento, case studies, contact + FAQ, footer.
- About (`/about`) - General about the studio (cream page, same typography and header as other inner pages).
- Contact (`/contact`) - Full contact + FAQ block on a dedicated dark page with the shared top bar.
- Work (`/work`) - Portfolio listing loaded from **Sanity** (each **work project** with “Show on /work” on); if Sanity is empty or unreachable, the site falls back to the same built-in list as before. Each **whole card** links to **`/work/{slug}`**. Category pills filter the grid. Revalidates about every minute.
- Work project pages (`/work/[slug]`) - Shared layout: dark hero (on **mobile**, text block **above** the hero image; **desktop** image left, copy right), cream **challenge** and **solution** copy, then a gallery with light hover zoom on images. Content is merged from **Sanity** with code fallbacks in **`lib/workProjectDefaults.ts`**. New projects can exist **only in Sanity** (no code entry) if the document includes a hero image (or path) and the rest of the required fields. No separate “The result” block or wide cover image. (True “case studies” are not modeled yet — that label is reserved for a future content type.)

## Components
- `AgentationProvider` - included by the app layout.
- `ScrollReveal` - optional scroll-into-view fade-up for section content; respects reduced-motion preferences.

## Sanity CMS (editable content)
The site is wired for [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/). **The live site does not ship the full Studio UI** (that bundle is too large for Cloudflare’s server limits). **Edit content** in [Sanity Manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage), or run the full **Studio** on your computer: in the project folder use **`npx sanity dev`**, then open the URL it prints (the config is still at **`/studio`**). On the **public site**, **`/studio`** is a small page with the same links and instructions.

**Local setup**
1. Copy **`.env.example`** to **`.env.local`** in the project root (same folder as `package.json`) for **`npm run dev`**. For **`npx sanity dev`**, the CLI usually reads **`.env`** (not `.env.local`); either copy the same vars into **`.env`** or rely on **defaults in `sanity/env.ts`** (same IDs as the example) so Studio starts without an extra file.
2. Set **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`** and **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`** if they differ from the example file.
3. For the **full** editing UI locally, run **`npx sanity dev`** and open the local Studio URL; sign in with the same Sanity account. To create a **Homepage** document, use the **Structure** or **Create** flow in that Studio.
4. In Sanity **Manage** → **API** → **CORS origins**, add `http://localhost:3000` (and your production URL when you deploy) so the browser can talk to the API.

**Deploy:** Add the same `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_*` variables to your host (e.g. Cloudflare **`.dev.vars`** / dashboard env) so builds don’t fail. **Cloudflare:** the Worker script must stay under the host’s size limit; on the **free** plan that limit is very small, so a **paid Workers** plan (larger limit) is usually needed for this OpenNext app, or use another host (e.g. Vercel) for production.

**Code:** Client in `sanity/lib/client.ts`, config in `sanity.config.ts`, schemas in `sanity/schemaTypes/` (starter **Homepage** type with optional hero fields — homepage UI still uses static copy until you add GROQ fetches).

### Work projects in Sanity
Each URL **`/work/{slug}`** loads a **work project** document in Sanity (type **`workProject`**; older **`caseStudy`** docs are still read until migrated). If the document is missing or a field is empty, the site uses **`lib/workProjectDefaults.ts`** for that slug.

**Seed all eight documents at once (recommended):**
1. In [Sanity Manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage) → your project → **API** → **Tokens**, create an **Editor** token.
2. In the project root, set **`SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN`** in **`.env`** or **`.env.local`**. (Optional: add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_*` from **`.env.example`** if you use a different project or dataset; otherwise the same defaults as **`sanity/env.ts`** are used.) The seed script loads those files with **`dotenv`**.
3. Run **`npm run seed:sanity-work-projects`** (or **`npm run seed:sanity-case-studies`**, same script). This upserts documents with IDs `workProject-{slug}`, filled with the same text as the code defaults (replace placeholder `https://example.com` URLs in Studio when you have real links).

**Or create one by hand in Studio:** **Create** → **Work project** → **Slug** must match the route (e.g. `slrp`, `3-fils`, `brix-journey`). **Publish**, then reload the page ( **`revalidate = 60`** ).

**Adding a new project later:** Add an entry to **`WORK_PROJECTS`** in `lib/workProjectDefaults.ts` if you want a code fallback, or create only a **Work project** in Sanity (or both). The **`/work`** listing is driven from Sanity; re-run the seed if you use it to sync from code defaults.

## Recent Changes
- 2026-04-24: **Cloudflare deploy:** Documented and scripted **`cf:workers`** (same as **`npm run deploy`**) for Workers Builds: **`npx wrangler deploy` alone fails** with “Could not find compiled Open Next config” if **`npm run build` never runs**; use a build step, or a single command **`npm run deploy`**. **README** and **`wrangler.jsonc` comments** describe the two patterns.
- 2026-04-24: **Sanity seed + `.env`:** The work-project seed script now loads **`.env`** and **`.env.local`** and uses the same project/dataset/API defaults as **`sanity/env.ts`**, so **`SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN`** alone is enough for **`npm run seed:sanity-work-projects`** when you point at the default project.
- 2026-04-23: **Contact form:** **WhatsApp number** (required, text label only). **Message is optional** (up to 2,000 characters). **Client + API validation**; **`noValidate`** so fields aren’t red until **after a failed submit**; then invalid fields get a **rose border** and short inline errors. **POST `/api/contact`**; optional Resend / webhook in `.env`.
- 2026-04-23: **`/work` filters:** Pills are **case-insensitive** vs project tags, sync with the URL as **`/work?category=…`**, and the bar scrolls horizontally on small screens. Empty filters show a short message. **Coming soon** page at **`/coming-soon`**; contact social icons and footer **Social** list link there until profiles launch (includes **X/Twitter** icon in the contact block).
- 2026-04-23: **Home services bento (mobile + polish):** Removed the **orange accent lines** under card titles, added spacing between **Web Design** text and image, a bit more **section top padding** on small screens, and the **Social** video is **shorter and wider** on mobile. **Homepage** cream band and **#work** use **tighter top rounding** on mobile than desktop.
- 2026-04-23: **Mobile menu polish:** The menu toggle is **after “Get in touch”**, uses **stroke line icons** (round caps) instead of solid blocks, and the sheet is **inset** with **large rounded corners**, extra **padding**, and a **Motion** (open/close) animation plus dimmed **backdrop** blur. Respects **reduced motion**.
- 2026-04-23: **Homepage header:** The hero uses the same shared **`SiteNavBar`** as inner pages, so the **hamburger and mobile link sheet** work on the homepage (earlier, only `SandspireHeader` pages had the menu; the old hero had no menu button). The mobile sheet is **`position: fixed`** below the bar so the hero’s **`overflow-hidden`** does not clip it.
- 2026-04-23: **Contact block:** A **`tel:`** link for **+971 56 198 0747** appears in the contact intro column (including the full **Contact** page and the homepage contact section).
- 2026-04-23: **Mobile + homepage work strip:** The top bar shows a **hamburger menu** on small screens with the same links as desktop (**Services, Work, About, Contact**). The footer **Menu** list matches that set (plus **Home**) and uses the same routes, including **Work** → `/work` instead of a separate “Projects” hash link. On the homepage **#work** section, each project row (image + copy + CTA) is a single link to **`/work/{slug}`**; the **Brix Journey** logo strip uses that name in `alt` text. **Shared nav data** for header and footer lives in `components/sandspire/sandspireNav.ts` (re-exported from the header for anything that still imports from there).
- 2026-04-23: **Naming:** The Sanity document type and code are now **work project** (not “case study”), to match the **Work** section; **case study** is reserved for a possible future page type. Schema type **`workProject`**, file **`lib/workProjectDefaults.ts`**, **`WorkProjectTemplate`**, and **`npm run seed:sanity-work-projects`**. GROQ still accepts legacy **`caseStudy`** documents until you migrate them in the CMS.
- 2026-04-23: **Work listing + Sanity:** The **`/work`** page now loads its project cards from **work project** documents in Sanity (order, show/hide on the grid, listing title, short description, card image). Adding or removing a project in Sanity updates the grid and **`/work/{slug}`** (new slugs no longer require a matching line in the code defaults). The category filter is interactive. If the Sanity query returns nothing, the site uses the previous hardcoded list as a fallback.
- 2026-04-23: **Work / Sanity:** The **wordmark** on each project page now uses the work project document’s *Internal title* from Sanity when present (it previously always used the code default only).
- 2026-04-23: **Cloudflare Worker size:** The huge server bundle (Sanity’s embedded **Studio** on `/studio`) was removed so the site can be deployed; the public **`/studio`** page only explains how to open **Sanity Manage** or run **`npx sanity dev`**. The production Worker is still a few **megabytes** — it can hit **free-plan** Cloudflare size limits, so a **paid Workers** plan (or a different host) is often needed. Dependencies were also trimmed (for example `next-sanity` replaced with a smaller client) where it helped.
- 2026-04-23: **Deploy installs:** Project dependencies were adjusted so automated installs (for example on Cloudflare) pull **newer supporting libraries** behind the scenes; this removes noisy “deprecated package” messages during `npm install` without changing what visitors see on the site.
- 2026-04-23: **Polish & mobile case studies:** Sitewide **hover / focus** micro-interactions (nav underlines, CTA lift + shadow, footer link nudge, work cards, homepage case rows, contact form + submit, FAQ pills, gallery image scale on case studies). **Case study hero:** on viewports below `lg`, **copy/meta appears first** and the **device image below** (`flex-col-reverse` + `lg:flex-row`).
- 2026-04-23: **Work listing (`/work`):** Removed **`ScrollReveal`** on this page (no load/scroll-in animation). Each project card is a single Next.js link to **`/work/{slug}`** so the entire card opens the case study; “View Project” is plain text inside that link.
- 2026-04-23: **Sanity work fetch:** GROQ loads are **capped at ~12 seconds** per slug; on timeout or network error the page uses **`lib/workProjectDefaults.ts`** and logs a dev warning. **`getWorkProjectBySlug`** is **request-cached** so `generateMetadata` and the page don’t double-fetch.
- 2026-04-23: **`ScrollReveal` / back navigation:** Reveal blocks now drive visibility with **`useInView` + `animate`**, a layout-time geometry check (double **`requestAnimationFrame`** for scroll restoration), **`popstate`** remeasure, and **`pageshow`** when **`persisted`** (bfcache). Fixes `/work` (and other pages) looking blank after the browser **Back** button because content stayed at **`opacity: 0`**.
- 2026-04-23: **Case study layout:** The former “brand detail” image (**`resultImageTall`** / tall result asset) now sits **under the phone** in the cream gallery column on every **`/work/[slug]`** page. The **“The result”** heading and the **wide “case study cover”** image are removed from the template (Sanity fields for those may remain but are unused on the site).
- 2026-04-23: **Case study images:** Hero and cream-gallery images size to the file’s aspect ratio (**`h-auto w-full`**) inside rounded frames so there’s no extra empty band above or below the art; frame backgrounds stay **`#1f1f1f`** (hero) and **`#faf3e8`** (gallery).
- 2026-04-23: **Work projects:** Eight routes **`/work/{slug}`** share the work project template with defaults in **`lib/workProjectDefaults.ts`**; the seed script upserts **work project** documents. Work listing **View Project** links go to each slug ( **`/work/slrp`** unchanged).
- 2026-04-23: **Dev:** If Turbopack crashes with missing cache files under `.next`, delete **`.next`** and run **`npm run dev`** again; **`npm run dev:webpack`** uses webpack instead of Turbopack as a fallback.
- 2026-04-23: **Sanity work project:** Document type **`workProject`**; pages load from Sanity with code fallbacks; GROQ in **`sanity/lib/queries/workProject.ts`**; ISR **`revalidate = 60`**.
- 2026-04-23: **Sanity:** Documented linking the repo to the Sanity cloud project; added **`.env.example`** (with `!.env.example` in gitignore so it can be committed), and a starter **`homepage`** schema. Full **Studio** is run with **`npx sanity dev`** (or Sanity Manage on the web); the public site’s `/studio` route is a help page, not the full editor.
- 2026-04-23: **SLRP page polish:** Cream block uses the same outer width and horizontal padding as the rest of the site (`max-w-[1220px]`, `px-6` / `lg:px-10`) with the case-study column centered inside; removed the image-row drop shadow; hero inner container no longer has bottom padding; “Visit Website” points to `https://www.slrpramen.com/`.
- 2026-04-23: **SLRP page (`/work/slrp`):** Reworked to match Figma node **164-4853** — hero uses a subtle dot grid on charcoal, rounded tablet frame for `slrp_header`, inverted SLRP logo for contrast, Alexandria-style pills and metadata labels, external-link “Visit Website” control; middle gallery is `slrpBento3` over `slrpBento1` with a full-height `slrpBento2` beside them; “The result” is centered with a simple two-image row (`slrpBento4` + `slrpBento5`). Challenge/solution copy stays substantive single paragraphs.
- 2026-04-23: **Cloudflare build:** the standard production build now produces the OpenNext worker bundle (not only a plain Next.js build), so the step that runs after the build on Cloudflare can find the worker and static assets. This avoids failed or stuck deploys when only `next build` had run before.
- 2026-04-23: **Cloudflare deploy fix:** the Worker’s **self-reference** in Wrangler is set to the same name as the deployed script (`sandspire`) so production deploys no longer fail with “Worker not found” for the service binding.
- 2026-04-23: **Scroll experience:** in-page anchor jumps use smooth scrolling when the visitor has not asked for reduced motion. Major blocks **fade and lift into view** as you scroll (hero copy + logo strip, who-we-are columns, services bento, homepage work strip, contact vs FAQ, footer, about page sections) via a shared `ScrollReveal` component; the **`/work`** listing itself does not use it; motion is disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is on.
- 2026-04-23: **Hero readability:** the full-screen video and gradient sit on lower layers; headline and body copy sit above decorative edge overlays so text is no longer covered. **New pages:** **About** (`/about`) on the cream background and **Contact** (`/contact`) reusing the homepage contact + FAQ styling on a full dark page. **SandspireHeader** is shared on work, SLRP, about, and contact with links to Services, Work, About, and Contact; the homepage hero bar matches. Footer menu now includes **Contact**, **About**, and home/services/projects links that work from any page (`/#…` where needed). The old `/3d-marquee-demo` route is a short placeholder so builds don’t depend on a removed demo file.
- 2026-04-23: **Pricing** and **Use cases** are hidden from the top menu on the homepage, `/work`, and `/work/slrp`, and **Pricing** was removed from the footer menu until you are ready to show them. Typography is slightly smaller and more consistent (lighter nav and CTAs, tuned hero and section headings, bento card titles, case study copy, contact/FAQ, footer). The **Who is Sandspire** block (`#who`) has more space above and below; services, work, and contact sections have a bit more vertical padding. The dark **Contact** panel uses a single `70px` top radius plus `overflow-hidden` so the curved top edge paints cleanly.
- 2026-04-23: All headings inside the homepage `main` (work titles, contact titles, FAQ heading, services titles, who-we-are lead line, footer column labels) use light weight (300) for a consistent thin title style; CSS also sets `main h1–h6` to weight 300 as a baseline.
- 2026-04-23: Work / projects section (`#work`) now uses a solid white background and explicit dark text so it stays visible in dark mode (it had disappeared when system dark theme set the cream token to near-black while headings stayed dark). Contact + FAQ updated to match Figma (153-2017): rounded top on the dark panel, two-column contact layout, bordered glass form, field styling, pill FAQ grid, underlined “more questions” link. Web Design marquee uses stronger isometric tilt, tighter perspective, aggressive edge bleed, gap-6, taller tiles, max two tiles per row, and fills its card; services left column stretches; Social video vertically centered.
- 2026-04-23: Hero follows the Figma hero block layout (left kicker + large title, right two-line headline + supporting paragraph, bottom four service columns) with Sandspire-focused copy; service labels match the bento (#01–#04). Services: Social card gets a full-bleed brighter glass + orange/red radial glow like the Figma reference; bento headings use medium weight on titles and normal on price lines; AI dot pattern nudged further down-right; Web Design marquee bleeds past its frame and scales up to fill the card. “What we do” uses medium weight; Agency Services eyebrow is normal weight.
- 2026-04-23: Services bento is more compact overall (narrower max width, shorter section and card heights, smaller type, tighter gaps, 24px card rounding, smaller Web Design marquee tiles). The orange “results” video sits in a half-height clipped frame with stronger top rounding, pushed lower with extra bottom bleed. The AI Automation dot background is shifted further right. Social column video height is reduced to match the shorter layout.
- 2026-04-23: Services bento: doubled the AI Automation diagram size, scaled up both analytics videos (orange “results” card and tall Social card) with the Social clip pinned to the bottom of its frame, tightened the results card bottom padding by 10px and extended the media layer past the card bottom so the video crops cleanly at the edge, and raised the results card minimum height for the larger video.
- 2026-04-23: Web Design service card: marquee tiles are three times larger with a consistent 3px frame border, the left title column is narrower so the marquee has more width, and the card is taller so the bigger tiles fit; restored the optional skew wrapper on the marquee band for the Figma-style angle.
- 2026-04-23: Shifted the AI Automation card dot-pattern background slightly right and down and scaled it larger so the texture fills the card more naturally.
- 2026-04-23: Rebuilt the homepage “What we do” services bento to match the Figma frame (node 153-837): wider grid, orange rule lines above pricing, first card headline “See real results you can measure” with the analytics video on a dark rounded plate, AI Automation card with a local dot-matrix background behind the icon diagram, Web Design previews skewed to match the comp, and a taller glass-style Social column with warm gradient glows behind the phone mockup.
- 2026-04-20: Refined service-pill styling so outlines are now neutral glass and only the outer glow carries the category color.
- 2026-04-20: Softened the new glassmorphism service-pill glow intensity on work pages while keeping the same color mapping by service type.
- 2026-04-20: Restyled work/project category pills with a glass-outline look and subtle color glows by service type (orange for Branding/Social Media, yellow for Web Development, soft white for AI Automation).
- 2026-04-20: Added click-outside behavior to the FAQ so any open answer closes automatically when clicking anywhere outside the FAQ area.
- 2026-04-20: Fixed FAQ grid card behavior so opening one answer no longer visually stretches the neighboring card in the same row.
- 2026-04-20: Increased spacing between each FAQ question and its expanded answer text across all FAQ cards for easier reading.
- 2026-04-20: Updated the homepage hero dark gradient overlay layer so it is sized with full width/height from the bottom-right anchor instead of using full inset positioning.
- 2026-04-20: Fixed FAQ title alignment by removing closed-state answer spacing and increased FAQ pill inner padding from 5px to 15px.
- 2026-04-20: Updated FAQ row pills to hug their content with 5px inner padding and tighter row spacing.
- 2026-04-17: Made the `/work/slrp` case-study section smaller again: reduced section vertical padding and container widths, tightened image block max widths/gaps, and lowered supporting/portrait image minimum heights for a more compact composition.
- 2026-04-17: Adjusted `/work/slrp` asymmetrical image block alignment for tablet/desktop feedback: shifted the grid left (`ml-0 mr-auto`), increased inter-column spacing (`48px→64px`), and added slight left inset on the portrait column.
- 2026-04-17: Scaled the `/work/slrp` image section down further per follow-up: reduced section/container widths and padding again, tightened the column gap slightly, and lowered image minimum heights (portrait `680→600`, supporting `280→240`).
- 2026-04-17: Refined `/work/slrp` image section spacing and scale: increased left/right column separation to a wider editorial gap (`56px` on desktop), reduced overall section/container width and padding, and scaled image heights down (portrait `780→680`, supporting `320→280`) while preserving alignment and aspect behavior.
- 2026-04-17: Changed `/work/slrp` portrait side borders to render outside the frame by replacing `border-x` with left/right hard box-shadows (`±128px`) so image width stays intact.
- 2026-04-17: Increased the `/work/slrp` portrait visual side-only black borders by another 4x, from `32px` to `128px`.
- 2026-04-17: Increased the `/work/slrp` portrait visual side-only black borders from `8px` to `32px` (4x thicker) while keeping top/bottom borderless.
- 2026-04-17: Updated the `/work/slrp` portrait visual frame with thick black left/right-only borders (`8px`) while keeping top and bottom edges borderless.
- 2026-04-17: Added consistent glass-style image framing across all `/work/slrp` visuals (translucent borders, subtle inner highlight, soft shadow, and slight backdrop blur) for a unified polished look.
- 2026-04-17: Fixed homepage image sources: Web Design bento now loads marquee assets from `public/images/bento/`, and the “Crafting legacy for teams that scale” case rows now use `3fils_img`, `brixjourney_img`, and `slrp_img` from `public/images/projects/...`.
- 2026-04-17: Updated `/work/slrp` result row so the left image now stretches to match the right image height (`h-full`) while preserving the current width split.
- 2026-04-17: Made the right image in the `/work/slrp` result row wider again by changing the column split from `0.38/0.62` to `0.3/0.7`.
- 2026-04-17: Increased the size of the two `/work/slrp` result images by expanding their row container max width from `560px` to `860px`.
- 2026-04-17: Fixed root hydration mismatch warning by adding `suppressHydrationWarning` to the `<html>` element in `app/layout.tsx`, preventing client-side attribute injection differences from triggering runtime overlay errors.
- 2026-04-17: Rebalanced the `/work/slrp` result image row to a wider right column (`0.38fr / 0.62fr`) so the right image takes more horizontal space while keeping the existing row height behavior and spacing.
- 2026-04-17: Increased the `/work/slrp` “SLRP result detail one” image height to match the left result image while keeping the same column width.
- 2026-04-17: Adjusted `/work/slrp` result image row sizing: reduced both result images to a smaller centered two-column block and added rounded corners to the “SLRP result detail one” image.
- 2026-04-17: Removed the `/work/slrp` result metric number/text block entirely and simplified the section to title + editorial paragraph + two equal-height result images (`slrpBento5` and `slrpBento4`).
- 2026-04-17: Updated `/work/slrp` visuals per latest QA: added left/right stroke on the portrait image, removed the metric card article wrappers in the result stats, and changed result row images to `slrpBento5` (hero) and `slrpBento4` (detail).
- 2026-04-17: Applied another `/work/slrp` image-role pass: swapped portrait/supporting placements in the asymmetrical grid, moved the portrait asset to result level 1, and removed rounded corners from the result image row wrappers.
- 2026-04-17: Applied `/work/slrp` polish updates: removed the top hero media drop shadow, switched the link glyph from a diagonal arrow to a short right arrow, removed rounding from the three result metric cards, and reassigned result/portrait image assets based on the latest content feedback.
- 2026-04-17: Updated `/work/slrp` content structure again per QA: swapped visual roles in the asymmetrical image grid (portrait now dominant, supporting image reduced), rebuilt “The result” into a two-column heading/text layout, removed the extra “result detail two” image, and kept the remaining result images side by side underneath.
- 2026-04-17: Redesigned `/work/slrp` case-study content into a cleaner editorial layout: light beige canvas, flat two-column challenge/solution typography, structured asymmetrical image grid, rebuilt centered results block, and removed the extra dark gallery section to reduce visual noise.
- 2026-04-17: Centered the top `/work/slrp` split project grid and removed negative side offsets so the block no longer leaves redundant right-side space.
- 2026-04-17: Updated `/work/slrp` hero intro per feedback: removed the standalone top title/description and external tag strip, then moved the project title and `Branding`/`Web Development` tags into the right project info panel.
- 2026-04-17: Tweaked `/work/slrp` top project frame again: made the media frame much smaller in the split layout, kept rounded top corners (including top-right), and increased the SLRP header image negative bottom margin for a tighter crop.
- 2026-04-17: Updated `/work/slrp` hero media to use `slrp_header.png` and increased the image negative bottom margin for a tighter flush fit in the top project card.
- 2026-04-17: Applied `/work/slrp` spacing cleanup from QA: removed the right intro info panel border, removed bottom padding in the first bordered section, removed bottom padding from the left intro media card, and added negative bottom margin to the main SLRP image for a flush edge.
- 2026-04-17: Corrected both `/work` wrapper closing tags together (header inner `</div>` and first content `</section>`) to fully resolve the repeated parse errors around lines 91 and 122.
- 2026-04-17: Fixed another JSX mismatch in `/work` by changing the closing tag after the category pills from `</div>` to `</section>`, resolving the line-122 parse error.
- 2026-04-17: Fixed a second JSX closing-tag mismatch in `/work` header markup (`</section>` corrected to `</div>`) to resolve another parse-time build error.
- 2026-04-17: Fixed a JSX structure bug on `/work` (mismatched closing tag in the intro section) that was causing a build parsing error.
- 2026-04-17: Restored the previous `/work` portfolio listing page and moved the long case-study layout to `/work/slrp`, then wired “View Project” links from the listing to open the detail page.
