# Sandspire

Sandspire is a custom marketing website for a creative studio focused on brand strategy, web design, social media, and AI automation. The site presents the studio's positioning, services, selected work, about page, and contact flow in a polished editorial-style layout.

## What the Site Includes

- A full-screen homepage hero with motion background and service overview
- A services section covering brand strategy, web design, social media marketing, and AI automation
- A selected work page with portfolio cards and work previews
- Dedicated `About` and `Contact` pages
- A contact section with FAQ content and a styled inquiry form

## Routes

- `/` - Homepage
- `/work` - Portfolio overview
- `/work/[slug]` - Work project pages (e.g. `/work/slrp`, `/work/3-fils`) — see `lib/workProjectDefaults.ts`
- `/about` - Studio overview
- `/contact` - Contact page and FAQ

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Motion
- OpenNext for Cloudflare deployment
- Sentry for errors and performance: **`@sentry/nextjs`** in the app (set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` / `SENTRY_DSN` — see [Next.js on Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/)) and **`@sentry/cloudflare`** in **`cf-worker-sentry.ts`** (Worker env: same DSN; see [Sentry for Cloudflare Workers](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/))

## Cloudflare (Workers Builds / `wrangler deploy`)

**“Could not find compiled Open Next config”** means the OpenNext build never ran: there is no **`.open-next/`** output yet. The repo’s **`wrangler.jsonc` includes a `build` command** that runs `opennextjs-cloudflare build` *before* Wrangler deploys, so a pipeline that only runs **`npx wrangler deploy`** can still work. Do **not** also set a **Build** step in the Cloudflare UI to `npm run build` unless you remove the Wrangler `build` block (or you will build OpenNext **twice**).

- **If your host has separate “Build” and “Deploy” steps:** e.g. **Build** = `npm run build`, **Deploy** = `npx wrangler deploy` (no duplicate build in `wrangler.jsonc`), *or* leave **Build** empty and rely on **Wrangler’s** `build.command` only.
- **Single command:** **`npm run deploy`** (or **`npm run cf:workers`**) = OpenNext build + deploy in one.

**Sentry on the Worker:** `wrangler.jsonc` **`main`** is **`cf-worker-sentry.ts`**, which wraps OpenNext’s **`.open-next/worker.js`** with **`@sentry/cloudflare` `withSentry`**. Set **`SENTRY_DSN`** or **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`** on the Worker in the Cloudflare dashboard. **`nodejs_compat`** is already in **`compatibility_flags`** (needed for `AsyncLocalStorage`).

**Free Workers plan (3 MB gzip):** production **`next build`** (used by OpenNext) leaves **`@sentry/nextjs` `withSentryConfig` off** so the server bundle stays small; **`next dev`** still enables it. Set **`OPENNEXT_WITH_SENTRY=1`** (or run **`npm run build:with-sentry`**) for a full production bundle with `@sentry/nextjs` (e.g. paid 10 MB). The Worker entry **`cf-worker-sentry.ts`** can still send events with **`@sentry/cloudflare`** if a DSN is set.

**Vercel OG (WASM):** production builds use **`npx next build --webpack`** with a **`NormalModuleReplacementPlugin`** so **`next/dist/compiled/@vercel/og`** is replaced by a tiny stub — that avoids `resvg` / `yoga` in the worker.

## Local Development

## Notes

- The contact form is currently presentational. Submitting it updates UI state, but it does not send data to a backend or email provider yet.
- `Agentation` only renders in development.
- Deployment is configured for Cloudflare using `@opennextjs/cloudflare` and `wrangler`.
